# Data Story and Visualization

## Introduction
Pokémon, a global icon for both children and adults, has expanded its influence across various media, including TV series, video games, card games, movies, and merchandise. The motivation behind this analysis is to gain insights into the dynamics of the Pokémon universe through data.

## Pokemon Types
I analyzed the distribution of Pokémon types, discovering that Water-type Pokémon are most prevalent in Type 1, while Flying-type Pokémon are the least common. In Type 2, Flying types are significant, and Bugs are the least represented.

## Single and Dual Types
To understand the impact of elemental powers, I created separate dataframes for single and dual types. It became apparent that Pokémon with dual elemental powers generally have better stats, providing versatility in battle. Further analysis focused on the dual elemental dataframe.

## Attack and Speed
Mega Mewtwo X dominated the attack scene with a score of 190, followed closely by Mega Heracross. In terms of speed, Ninjask led with a score of 160, followed by Pheromosa at 151, and Iron Bundle surprisingly making the top 10 with a speed score of 136.

## Defense and Hitpoint
Eternatus Eternamax showcased unmatched defense with a score of 250. Shuckle and Mega Steelix followed closely with a robust defense score of 230. In hitpoints, Eternatus Eternamax remained supreme with a score of 250, closely trailed by Guzzlord at 223.

## Strong and Balanced Pokemons
Examining the plots, it's clear that only a few Pokémon occur twice, emphasizing the inadequacy of relying on a single statistic. Filtering the dataframe for Pokémon with at least average values in each stat resulted in a selection of strong and balanced Pokémon, excelling in both offense and defense.

## Thought Process
The thought process involves understanding the distribution of Pokémon types, comparing single and dual types, analyzing key stats such as attack, speed, defense, and hitpoints, and identifying strong and balanced Pokémon through strategic filtering.

## Algorithms/Libraries Used for Visualization
Power BI was employed for the visualization of the Pokémon data.

## Conclusion
In summary, the analysis provides insights into what makes a Pokémon strong in battles. Pokémon with dual elemental powers tend to perform better, and considering various factors, including average values, helps in identifying well-rounded Pokémon. This analysis equips trainers with a comprehensive view for making strategic decisions in team-building and competitions.
